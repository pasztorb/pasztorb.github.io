I am a doctoral fellow at the [ETH AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch) supervised by [Prof. Dr. Andreas Krause](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/krausea)
and [Prof. Dr. Sven Seuken](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/ce/people/seuken.html). My research focuses on multi-agent learning in 
general-sum games that obtains several equilibria with non-equivalent social welfare. I am aiming to answer questions around
when and how to agents learn these equilibria, and how to encourage cooperation to higher social welfare. I am actively
seeking applications in the areas of economics, finance, transportation, and energy.
