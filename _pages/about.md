I am a doctoral fellow at the [ETH AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch) supervised by [Prof. Dr. Andreas Krause](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/krausea)
and [Prof. Dr. Giorgia Ramponi](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/alpi/people/ramponi.html).
My research focuses on (multi-agent) reinforcement learning, online learning, bilevel optimisation, and sample-efficient
learning from human feedback. Currently, my main focus is on fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) but
I am actively seeking other applications in the areas such as economics or finance.
