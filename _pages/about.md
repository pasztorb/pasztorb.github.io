I am a doctoral fellow at the [ETH AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch) supervised by [Prof. Dr. Andreas Krause](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/krausea)
and [Prof. Dr. Sven Seuken](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/ce/people/seuken.html).
My research focuses on (multi-agent) reinforcement learning, online learning, bilevel optimisation, and sample-efficient
learning from human feedback.
I am actively seeking applications in the areas of economics, finance, transportation, and energy.

If you are interested in working together, feel free to reach out to me via email.
