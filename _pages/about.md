I am a doctoral fellow at the [ETH AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch) supervised by [Prof. Dr. Andreas Krause](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/krausea)
and [Prof. Dr. Giorgia Ramponi](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/alpi/people/ramponi.html).
My research focuses on (multi-agent) reinforcement learning, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and active learning.
In particular, I am interested in game theoretic formulations of optimization problems in these areas.
Ongoing projects are centered around sample-efficient data collection in RLHF to reduce annotation costs for LLM post-training
and optimizing for complex preference structures beyond reward models.

I was a core contributor and lead of the post-training team at the [Swiss AI Initiative](https://www.swiss-ai.org) during the development of the open-source large language model [Apertus](https://huggingface.co/swiss-ai/Apertus-70B-Instruct-2509).
