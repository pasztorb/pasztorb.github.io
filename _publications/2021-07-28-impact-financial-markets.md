**Abstract**:
We quantify the propagation and absorption of large-scale publicly available news articles from the World Wide Web to
financial markets. To extract publicly available information, we use the news archives from the Common Crawl,
a non-profit organization that crawls a large part of the web. We develop a processing pipeline to identify news
articles associated with the constituent companies in the S&P 500 index, an equity market index that measures the stock
performance of US companies. Using machine learning techniques, we extract sentiment scores from the Common Crawl News
data and employ tools from information theory to quantify the information transfer from public news articles to the US
stock market. Furthermore, we analyse and quantify the economic significance of the news-based information with a
simple sentiment-based portfolio trading strategy. Our findings provide support for that information in publicly
available news on the World Wide Web has a statistically and economically significant impact on events in financial markets.
